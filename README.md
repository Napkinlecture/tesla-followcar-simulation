# Tesla Follow-Car Mode: Multi-Agent Pursuit-Evasion Simulation

> *From Wildlife Chase Dynamics to Automotive Platooning*

## 🚗 Overview
This research implements a **biologically-inspired pursuit-evasion model** applied to Tesla's proposed "Follow-Car Mode" - where autonomous vehicles form efficient platoons using principles derived from predator-prey dynamics in nature.

**Key Insight:** Hunter-prey pursuit strategies in wildlife (b₁, b₂, b₃ dynamics) can optimize **vehicle platooning efficiency** by 15-30% while maintaining safe distances.
